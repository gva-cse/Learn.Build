Azure Fundamentals : Azure Fundamentals is a learning path that introduces beginners to the core concepts, architecture, and key services of Microsoft Azure. It provides a solid foundation for understanding and using Azure effectively.

Compute services: Azure offers a variety of Compute services that allow you to deploy and manage virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing resources. You can choose from various options such as Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Functions. These services enable you to run your applications and workloads efficiently in the cloud.

Network services: Azure's Network services provide you with the tools to build and manage your network infrastructure in the cloud. You can create virtual networks, configure subnets, set up virtual private networks (VPNs), and implement load balancers for high availability and scalability. Additionally, you can explore Azure Firewall and Azure DDoS Protection for enhanced network security.

Inbound and Outbound rule creations: As part of managing your network security in Azure, you can create inbound and outbound rules in network security groups (NSGs). NSGs act as virtual firewalls, allowing you to control traffic flow to and from your virtual machines or subnets. By defining specific rules, you can ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed and protect your resources from unauthorized access.

IAM and Security monitoring: Azure provides robust Identity and Access Management (IAM) capabilities to manage user access and permissions. With IAM, you can create users, groups, and roles, assign granular permissions, and enforce least privilege principles. Additionally, Azure offers various security monitoring tools such as Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel, which help you detect, investigate, and respond to potential threats in real-time.

RBAC - role-based access control: RBAC is a fundamental concept in Azure that allows you to assign specific roles and permissions to users or groups at different levels of your Azure resources. By using RBAC, you can ensure that users have the appropriate level of access based on their responsibilities. This helps enforce security and maintain control over your Azure environment.

IAM - Identity Access Management: In addition to RBAC, Azure provides comprehensive Identity Access Management (IAM) features. IAM allows you to manage user identities, authentication methods, and authorization policies across your Azure environment. You can integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to enable single sign-on (SSO) and manage user identities centrally.
